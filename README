hpricot-pure - simply Hpricot, just made "pure".
===============================================================================

PREMISE: THIS IS JUST AN EXPERIMENT

Ok I was just bored, but as an unexpected result of my boredom, hpricot-pure 
turned out to be actually functioning after a couple of hours of laid-back 
hacking so I thought "why not releasing the source code?".

hpricot-pure is a version of Hpricot that doesn't rely on a native extension, 
instead it is written entirely in pure Ruby. It is currently based on Hpricot 
0.6.164 and I have no plans to support later versions of Hpricot, but I might 
reconsider this after pushing out the new features of Hpricot into 
ironruby-hpricot.

Ok so now what is the point of hpricot-pure? Well, as I have said I was bored, 
there is really nothing much to say. But I can't exclude that someone may find 
it useful :)

NOTE: fast_xs is still missing, which means all the tests where XML/HTML 
character escaping matters will fail until I get it done.
